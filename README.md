# Event Scheduling System — Data Structures & Algorithms Project

## Team Contributions

### **Aayush Bharadwaj**

**Part A: Event Storage Structures**

- Implemented two event storage systems: **Dynamic ArrayList** and **Singly Linked List**
- Supported operations: insert, delete, search_by_id, list_all
- Built the Random Event Generator
- Wrote unit tests for Part A

### **Nivid Pathak**

**Part B: Sorting Algorithms**

- Implemented Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort
- Optimized for both array and linked list backends
- Added helper functions: append, to_list, from_list
- Conducted runtime comparisons for n = 50, 500, 5,000, and 50,000 events
- Wrote unit tests for Part B

### **Thiyagu Rajendran**

**Part C: Searching & Conflict Detection**

- Developed Linear Search and Binary Search for event lookup by ID
- Created Conflict Detection algorithms
- Wrote unit tests for Part C- Searching Algorithms

### **Antoni Czołgowski**

**Part D. Scalability Challenge and Part C: Conflict Detection**

- Project Management
- Created Conflict Detection algorithms
- Wrote unit tests for Part C- Conflict Detection Algorithms
- Integrated all modules into one system
- Wrote complexity (Big O) and scalability analysis for all algorithms
- Proposed optimization strategies for 1 000 000-event scalability.
- Prepared a Demo

## Design Assumptions

Each event includes only a **single starting time** rather than a duration.  
This simplification reduces computational complexity, ensures predictable runtime behavior, and keeps the system easily adaptable for future versions that handle duration-based events.

## Project Status

All components are implemented, verified, and benchmarked.  
**Result:** 10 automated tests and 2 visualization test — **100% success rate**
